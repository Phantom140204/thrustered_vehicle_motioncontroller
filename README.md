This repo is a modified version of: https://github.com/auvsocietyiiitdm/thrustered_vehicle_motioncontroller.git

This library has all the features of the previous version, with a few extra changes:
-> Vehicle Config is now in XML format
-> All settings including thruster configurations are in a single config file - vehicle_config.xml
-> This library reads from the config file and updates its variables accordingly everytime it is run, so no need of compilation everytime config is changed!
